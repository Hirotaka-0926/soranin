I can design inherited classes.
Super class is Point class. Sub class is MovingPoint class.
Point class has two fields.
MovingPoint class has two fields.
Point class has two methods.
MovingPoint class has three methods.
If I change Point class, MovingPoint class is changed too.
operation at the end of TestObjectApplication can execute.
Because MovingPoint class inherited Point class.
 So MovingPoint class can be treated as a Point class.
