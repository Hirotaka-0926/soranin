The 6 operation is implicit casts.

The 3 operation is expicit casts.

object of type MovingPoint inherit object of type Point. 
So object of type MovingPoint treatd as a object of type of Point.

In operation 3, If we do implict casting, the programm make error.
Because o3 is not know to the compiler to be a MovingPoint.
